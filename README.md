# Sudoku

This is a program that iteratively solves sudoku puzzles.

I am currently adding more functionality.

My current To-Do list is:

    -Generating a random puzzle
    -Adding a prompt that easily allows you to enter in a puzzle to solve.
    -Adding a difficulty setting to the random generation
    -Add an option to change the size of the sudoku grid
    
I'll add more as I think of more features to add.

Feel free to take a look or try it out for yourself!
